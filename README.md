# Hangman Game

> My first project for AiCore, creating a simple hangman game on python.

## Tools used with prior knowledge

- Python as the sole programming language
    - Importing modules (random)
    - Classes
    - Various different loops

## New tools used:

- List comprehension
- Git from the terminal to commit various changes, before pushing them to GitHub


## Conclusions

- Improvements could be made by adding a visualisation of the number of lives left, such as another line being 'drawn' as each life is lost. This would not be too dificult to implement with a simple dictionary correspending the number of lives left to the drawing outputted in the terminal.
